writing a journal entry
trying some deep breathing exercises
taking a relaxing bath
drinking a cup of hot tea
watching an episode of your favorite Netflix show
taking a hot shower
cooking your favorite meal
making a list of everything you are thankful for today
listening to your favorite song
watching your favorite movie
