Writing a journal entry
Trying some deep breathing exercises 
Taking a relaxing bath
Drinking a cup of hot tea 
Watching an episode of your favorite Netflix show
Taking a hot shower 
Cooking your favorite meal
Make a list of everything you are thankful for today
Listen to your favorite song
Watch your favorite movie
